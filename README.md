Insperation taken from my other repo: [Ansible_Mac_Dev_Config](https://github.com/BenWolfaardt/Ansible_Mac_Dev_Config)

## TODOs

- Check if things are already installed before re-running them in full
- see more details from sys0dm1n for `notify: Update apt cache`
- Browser
    - Browser extensions
- General maintenance
    - Check if Discord has a new version, then delete current version and install new version
    - A cronjob that runs sudo-update at x interval
